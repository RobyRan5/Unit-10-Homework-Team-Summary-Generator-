# Note to TA's or whomever grades our homework. I got lost over the last week or so of class. So much that I'm taking the next two weeks off from work and reviewing all the material we have covered thus far. I will also be redoing this assignment as I am currently stuck. Please forgive my incompleteness and expect a completed assignment turned in before the start of the next session. Happy Holidays! All love. Roby
